# Speed Typing Test

This is a simple command-line typing game that measures the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM). The game presents the user with a randomly selected phrase, which the user must type out as quickly and accurately as possible.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the `main.py` file in your command-line interface of choice. The game requires the `curses` library, so make sure it is installed before running the game.

When you start the game, you will be presented with a welcome screen. Press any key to begin the test.

## Gameplay
Once the test begins, a phrase will be displayed on the screen. Your goal is to type out the phrase as quickly and accurately as possible. As you type, your progress will be displayed on the screen. The game will track your WPM in real-time, which will be displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen.

If you make a mistake while typing, the incorrect characters will be highlighted in red. Once you have successfully typed out the entire phrase, press any key to continue to the next phrase.

## Exiting the Game
To exit the game at any time, press the `Esc` key.

## Customization
If you want to use your own phrases for the game, simply add them to the text.txt file, with each phrase on a separate line. The game will select a random phrase from the file each time it is played.
